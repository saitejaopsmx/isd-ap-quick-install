**Quick Install for ISD,ArgoCD,ArgoRollouts,Elastic and Promethues**.

To experience ISD quickly, you can install it and deploy your applications. Note that the instructions below are intended to get you started quickly and try out ISD functionality. This is not suitable for production or any environment where security is a concern.
To begin installation, you'll need a Kubernetes cluster  (with 2 nodes with 32GB RAM each) and kubectl set-up.

## Steps to be followed

- **Namespace will be created automatically**

- **Apply the yaml files**

      kubectl -n opsmx-argo apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpsMx/isd-ap-quick-install/vela/isd-argo-elastic-prom/isd-argo-elastic-prometheus-quick.yaml

   WAIT for about 10-15 min, depending on network speed.
 
   It is normal for some pods to go into error/crashloop before stabilising.

 - **Check the status of the pods by executing this command**

       kubectl -n opsmx-argo get po

     Once all pods show "Running" or "Completed" status, execute below command
       
       kubectl -n opsmx-argo port-forward svc/oes-ui 8093 & kubectl -n opsmx-argo port-forward svc/isdargo-argocd-server 8099:80
      

 - **Access the ISD UI**
      
     Login using browser with http://localhost:8093
     
     - username **admin**

     Password can be retrieve the by using the below command
     
       kubectl -n opsmx-argo get secret -n opsmx-argo openldap -o jsonpath='{.data.LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD}'| base64 -d
       
 - **Access the Argo CD UI**

    Open another tab in the same browser and navigate to http://localhost:8099 Login with username admin password xxxxxxxxxx

    Execute the below command to get the password

       kubectl -n opsmx-argo get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
